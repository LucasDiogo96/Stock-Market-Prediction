## About the project

This is an experimental example about how to make stock market predictions using linear regression and is working in progress for improvements.

### What is stock market?

The stock market refers to public markets that exist for issuing, buying, and selling stocks that trade on a stock exchange or over-the-counter. Stocks, also known as equities, represent fractional ownership in a company, and the stock market is a place where investors can buy and sell ownership of such investible assets. An efficiently functioning stock market is considered critical to economic development, as it gives companies the ability to quickly access capital from the public.

### What is linear regression

Linear Regression is the supervised Machine Learning model in which the model finds the best fit linear line between the independent and dependent variable i.e it finds the linear relationship between the dependent and independent variable.

### Goal

In this project we will try to predict or get as close as possible to the value of a stock for data not yet observed.
